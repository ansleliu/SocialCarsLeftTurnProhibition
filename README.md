# Lane-based Signal Optimization with Left Turn Prohibition in Urban Road Networks
(Here Part of the project codeï¼Œ**Not for commercial use!!!**)  

**Abstract**  
Left turns may generate efficiency problems which can be solved by appropriately prohibiting left turns. The goal of this paper is to propose a method for purpose of minimizing total travel times in urban road networks by prohibiting left turns. With left turn prohition, the signal timing plan is optimized with the lane-based method because the method can properly handle both signal timing optimization and lane assignment. The total travel time is calculated with link flows and link travel time being estimated with signal settings. In numerical examples, prohibiting left turns reduces the total travel time of car traffic in road networks but lengthens some of the path travel times. As the left turn prohibition results can handle changeable demands, these results provide potential implications on congestion management.
